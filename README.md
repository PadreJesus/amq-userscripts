# AMQ scripts

## `userscripts`

Collection of \*monkey userscripts for Anime Music Quiz

### `amqCoopPaste.user.js`

Kinda defunct now with official teams mode, but playing as individual players still gives more XP/notes per right answer if everyone is on their own.
When turned on, automatically pastes your answer into the chat.

Maybe I will eventually add the ability to automatically copy paste someone else's answer from chat into your own box.

### `amqVideoBackground.user.js`

Changes AMQ background to the specified video. Edit the script to choose the URL. Somehow this breaks the IHI ladder assist and I don't know why yet.

### `amqHotkeys.user.js`

Streamlined version of nyamu's hotkey script that conflicts less with normal usage. Customize hotkeys by editing the keyBinds object.

#### Default bindings:

- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: remove zombie tooltips
- <kbd>Tab</kbd>: move cursor focus to answer box
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>: move cursor focus to chat box
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: skip
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>: start game if all players are ready
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>: start vote for returning to lobby
