# AMQ scripts

## `userscripts`

Collection of \*monkey userscripts for Anime Music Quiz

### `amqAutocase.user.js`

Changes your answer to lowercase so you can pretend you didn't use dropdown, or alternate casing to troll.

### `amqCoopPaste.user.js`

Kinda defunct now with official teams mode, but playing as individual players still gives more XP/notes per right answer if everyone is on their own.
When turned on, automatically pastes your answer into the chat, and pastes other players' answers from chat into your own box if they have the script enabled.

Use at your own peril.

### `amqCustomCommands.user.js`

Script for various chat commands. Currently only has the command for assigning targets in spy vs. spy mode.

### `amqHotkeys.user.js`

Customizable hotkeys with various game and lobby functions. Also has auto skip and auto ready built in.

### `amqListEntryCounter.user.js`

Similar to Joseph's song counter script, this counts the total number of entries on your list with songs.

Choose the following settings in the lobby before starting, if desired:

- Difficulty
- Song Type
- Dub/Rebroadcast

### `amqMuteOnAnswer.user.js`

Mutes the current song once you answer or the replay phase starts, and unmutes audio back on once the next song starts.

### `amqVideoBackground.user.js`

Changes AMQ background to the specified video. Edit the script to choose the URL. Somehow this breaks the IHI ladder assist and I don't know why yet.
