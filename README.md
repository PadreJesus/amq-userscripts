# AMQ scripts

## `userscripts`

Collection of \*monkey userscripts for Anime Music Quiz

### `amqCoopPaste.user.js`

Kinda defunct now with official teams mode, but playing as individual players still gives more XP/notes per right answer if everyone is on their own. When turned on, automatically pastes your answer into the chat, and pastes other players' answers from chat into your own box if they have the script enabled.

Use at your own peril.

### `amqVideoBackground.user.js`

Changes AMQ background to the specified video. Edit the script to choose the URL. Somehow this breaks the IHI ladder assist and I don't know why yet.

### `amqHotkeys.user.js`

Streamlined version of nyamu's hotkey script that conflicts less with normal usage. Customize hotkeys by editing the keyBinds object.
